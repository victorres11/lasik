Personal project to play around with the idea of using OCR and PDF parsing technology that started with a hypothesis of what some non-tech companies might have a need for in their workflows.

The goal here is to get familiar and play around with some specific technologies for experience. I've decided to favor getting something out into a production enviornment as quickly as possible over creating the most robust or elegant application.

Some technologies used include: React, Gulp, Heroku, Sass, AWS, Docker, Python, Node, Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision API, Bootstrap, etc.
